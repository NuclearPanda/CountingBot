# CountingBot
A counting bot for Rockman Discord

A discord bot that checks if a new message in the channel is the last one + 1

Example:

UserA: 1 <br>
UserB: 2 <br>
UserC: 5 <br>
Bot: failed <br>
UserD: 1 <br>
UserA: 2 <br>

The idea is to get as high as possible, the moderators of the discord were manually checking each message and so I made this bot to automate that.
